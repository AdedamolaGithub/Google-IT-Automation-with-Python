# Practice Quiz: For Loops

1. How are while loops and for loops different in Python?
    - While loops can be used with all data types, for loops can only be used with numbers.
    - For loops can be nested, but while loops can't.
    - While loops iterate while a condition is true, for loops iterate through a sequence of elements.
    - While loops can be interrupted using break, for loops using continue.
    ```
    Answer: While loops iterate while a condition is true, for loops iterate through a sequence of elements.
    Explanation: We can use while loops when we want our code to execute repeatedly while a condition is true, and for loops when we want to execute a block of code for each element of a sequence.
    ```

2. Fill in the blanks to make the factorial function return the factorial of n. Then, print the first 10 factorials (from 0 to 9) with the corresponding number. Remember that the factorial of a number is defined as the product of an integer and all integers before it. For example, the factorial of five (5!) is equal to 1*2*3*4*5=120. Also recall that the factorial of zero (0!) is equal to 1.
    ```python
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for x in range(1,___):
            result = ___ * ___
        return ___

    for n in range(___,___):
        print(n, factorial(n+___))
    ```
    Answer:
    ```python
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for x in range(1, n):
            result = result * x
        return result

    for n in range(0,10):
        print(n, factorial(n+1))
    ```

3. Write a script that prints the first 10 cube numbers (x**3), starting with x=1 and ending with x=10.
    ```python
    for __ in range(__,__):
        print(__)
    ```
    Answer:
    ```python
    for x in range(1,11):
        print(x**3)
    ```

4. Write a script that prints the multiples of 7 between 0 and 100. Print one multiple per line and avoid printing any numbers that aren't multiples of 7. Remember that 0 is also a multiple of 7.
    ```python
    print()
    ```
    Answer:
    ```python
    for i in range(101):
        if (i % 7 == 0):
            print(i)
    ```

5. The retry function tries to execute an operation that might fail, it retries the operation for a number of attempts.  Currently the code will keep executing the function even if it succeeds. Fill in the blank so the code stops trying after the operation succeeded.
    ```python
    def retry(operation, attempts):
        for n in range(attempts):
            if operation():
                print("Attempt " + str(n) + " succeeded")
                ___
            else:
                print("Attempt " + str(n) + " failed")

    retry(create_user, 3)
    retry(stop_service, 5)
    ```
    Answer:
    ```python
    def retry(operation, attempts):
        for n in range(attempts):
            if operation():
                print("Attempt " + str(n) + " succeeded")
                break
            else:
                print("Attempt " + str(n) + " failed")

    retry(create_user, 3)
    retry(stop_service, 5)
    ```
