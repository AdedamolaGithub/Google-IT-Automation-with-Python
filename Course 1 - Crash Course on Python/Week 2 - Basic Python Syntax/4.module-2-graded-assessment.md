# Module 2 Graded Assessment

1. Complete the function by filling in the missing parts. The color_translator function receives the name of a color, then prints its hexadecimal value. Currently, it only supports the three additive primary colors (red, green, blue), so it returns "unknown" for all other colors.
    ```python
    def color_translator(color):
        if ___ == "red":
            hex_color = "#ff0000"
        elif ___ == "green":
            hex_color = "#00ff00"
        elif ___ == "blue":
            hex_color = "#0000ff"
        ___:
            hex_color = "unknown"
        return ___

    print(color_translator("blue")) # Should be #0000ff
    print(color_translator("yellow")) # Should be unknown
    print(color_translator("red")) # Should be #ff0000
    print(color_translator("black")) # Should be unknown
    print(color_translator("green")) # Should be #00ff00
    print(color_translator("")) # Should be unknown
    ```
    Answer:
    ```python
    def color_translator(color):
        if color == "red":
            hex_color = "#ff0000"
        elif color == "green":
            hex_color = "#00ff00"
        elif color == "blue":
            hex_color = "#0000ff"
        else:
            hex_color = "unknown"
        return hex_color

    print(color_translator("blue")) # Should be #0000ff
    print(color_translator("yellow")) # Should be unknown
    print(color_translator("red")) # Should be #ff0000
    print(color_translator("black")) # Should be unknown
    print(color_translator("green")) # Should be #00ff00
    print(color_translator("")) # Should be unknown
    ```

2. What's the value of this Python expression: "big" > "small"
    - True
    - False
    - big
    - small
    ```
    Answer: False
    Explanation: The conditional operator > checks if two values are equal. The result of that operation is a boolean: either True or False. Alphabetically, "big" is less than "small".
    ```

3. What is the elif keyword used for?
    - To mark the end of the if statement
    - To handle more than two comparison cases
    - To replace the "or" clause in the if statement
    - Nothing - it's a misspelling of the else-if keyword
    ```
    Answer: To handle more than two comparison cases
    Explanation: The elif keyword is used in place of multiple embedded if clauses, when a single if/else structure is not enough.
    ```

4. Students in a class receive their grades as Pass/Fail. Scores of 60 or more (out of 100) mean that the grade is "Pass". For lower scores, the grade is "Fail". In addition, scores above 95 (not included) are graded as "Top Score". Fill in this function so that it returns the proper grade.
    ```python
    def exam_grade(score):
        if ___:
            grade = "Top Score"
        elif ___:
            grade = "Pass"
        else:
            grade = "Fail"
        return grade

    print(exam_grade(65)) # Should be Pass
    print(exam_grade(55)) # Should be Fail
    print(exam_grade(60)) # Should be Pass
    print(exam_grade(95)) # Should be Pass
    print(exam_grade(100)) # Should be Top Score
    print(exam_grade(0)) # Should be Fail
    ```
    Answer:
    ```python
    def exam_grade(score):
        if score > 95 and score <= 100:
            grade = "Top Score"
        elif score >= 60 and score <= 95:
            grade = "Pass"
        else:
            grade = "Fail"
        return grade

    print(exam_grade(65)) # Should be Pass
    print(exam_grade(55)) # Should be Fail
    print(exam_grade(60)) # Should be Pass
    print(exam_grade(95)) # Should be Pass
    print(exam_grade(100)) # Should be Top Score
    print(exam_grade(0)) # Should be Fail
    ```

5. What's the value of this Python expression: 11 % 5?
    - 2.2
    - 2
    - 1
    - 0
    ```
    Answer: 1
    Explanation: "%" is the modulo operator, which returns the remainder of the integer division between two numbers. 11 divided by 5 equals 2 with remainder of 1.
    ```

6. Complete the body of the __format_name__ function. This function receives the __first_name__ and __last_name__ parameters and then returns a properly formatted string.

   Specifically:

   If both the __last_name__ and the __first_name__ parameters are supplied, the function should return like so:
    ```python
    print(format_name("Ella", "Fitzgerald"))
    ```
    ```
    Name: Fitzgerald, Ella
    ```
    If only __one__ name parameter is supplied (either the first name _or_ the last name) , the function should return like so:
    ```python
    print(format_name("Adele", ""))
    ```
    ```
    Name: Adele
    ```
    or
    ```python
    print(format_name("", "Einstein"))
    ```
    ```
    Name: Einstein
    ```
    Finally, if both names are blank, the function should return the empty string:
    ```python
    print(format_name("", ""))
    ```
    ```
    ```
    Implement below:
    ```python
    def format_name(first_name, last_name):
        # code goes here
        
        return string 

    print(format_name("Ernest", "Hemingway"))
    # Should return the string "Name: Hemingway, Ernest"

    print(format_name("", "Madonna"))
    # Should return the string "Name: Madonna"

    print(format_name("Voltaire", ""))
    # Should return the string "Name: Voltaire"

    print(format_name("", ""))
    # Should return an empty string
    ```
    Answer:
    ```python
    def format_name(first_name, last_name):
        # code goes here
        string = ""
        if first_name == "" and last_name == "":
            return string
        elif first_name == "" and last_name != "":
            string = last_name
        elif first_name != "" and last_name == "":
            string = first_name
        else:
            string = last_name + ", " + first_name
        return "Name: " + string 

    print(format_name("Ernest", "Hemingway"))
    # Should return the string "Name: Hemingway, Ernest"

    print(format_name("", "Madonna"))
    # Should return the string "Name: Madonna"

    print(format_name("Voltaire", ""))
    # Should return the string "Name: Voltaire"

    print(format_name("", ""))
    # Should return an empty string
    ```

7. The longest_word function is used to compare 3 words. It should return the word with the most number of characters (and the first in the list when they have the same length). Fill in the blank to make this happen.
    ```python
    def longest_word(word1, word2, word3):
        if len(word1) >= len(word2) and len(word1) >= len(word3):
            word = word1
        elif ___:
            word = word2
        else:
            word = word3
        return(word)

    print(longest_word("chair", "couch", "table"))
    print(longest_word("bed", "bath", "beyond"))
    print(longest_word("laptop", "notebook", "desktop"))
    ```
    Answer:
    ```python
    def longest_word(word1, word2, word3):
        if len(word1) >= len(word2) and len(word1) >= len(word3):
            word = word1
        elif len(word2) >= len(word1) and len(word2) >= len(word3):
            word = word2
        else:
            word = word3
        return(word)

    print(longest_word("chair", "couch", "table"))
    print(longest_word("bed", "bath", "beyond"))
    print(longest_word("laptop", "notebook", "desktop"))
    ```

8. What’s the output of this code?
    ```python
    def sum(x, y):
		return(x+y)
    print(sum(sum(1,2), sum(3,4)))
    ```
    ```
    Answer: 10
    Explanation: We’re calling the sum function 3 times: returning 3, then 7, then adding up 3 plus 7 for the total of 10.
    ```

9. What's the value of this Python expression?
    ```python
    ((10 >= 5*2) and (10 <= 5*2))
    ```
    - True
    - False
    - 10
    - 5*2
    ```
    Answer: True
    Explanation: When using the "and" operator, a statement is True if both parts of the conditional are True.
    ```

10. The fractional_part function divides the numerator by the denominator, and returns just the fractional part (a number between 0 and 1). Complete the body of the function so that it returns the right number.
    Note: Since division by 0 produces an error, if the denominator is 0, the function should return 0 instead of attempting the division.
    ```python
    def fractional_part(numerator, denominator):
        # Operate with numerator and denominator to 
        # keep just the fractional part of the quotient
        return 0

    print(fractional_part(5, 5)) # Should be 0
    print(fractional_part(5, 4)) # Should be 0.25
    print(fractional_part(5, 3)) # Should be 0.66...
    print(fractional_part(5, 2)) # Should be 0.5
    print(fractional_part(5, 0)) # Should be 0
    print(fractional_part(0, 5)) # Should be 0
    ```
    Answer:
    ```python
    def fractional_part(numerator, denominator):
        # Operate with numerator and denominator to 
        # keep just the fractional part of the quotient
        if numerator == 0 or denominator == 0:
            return 0
        return (numerator / denominator) - (numerator // denominator)

    print(fractional_part(5, 5)) # Should be 0
    print(fractional_part(5, 4)) # Should be 0.25
    print(fractional_part(5, 3)) # Should be 0.66...
    print(fractional_part(5, 2)) # Should be 0.5
    print(fractional_part(5, 0)) # Should be 0
    print(fractional_part(0, 5)) # Should be 0
    ```
