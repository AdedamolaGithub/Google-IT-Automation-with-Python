# Practice Quiz: Running Python Locally

1. When your IDE automatically creates an indent for you, this is known as what?
    - Syntax highlighting
    - Code completion
    - Interpreted language
    - Code reuse
    ```
    Answer: Code completion
    Explanation: Code completion is an IDE feature that takes educated guesses about what you might be trying to type next, and offers suggestions to complete it for you.
    ```

2. Can you identify the error in the following code?
    ```python
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    import numpy as np

    def numpyArray():
        x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], np.int32)
        y = numpy.array([[3, 6, 2], [9, 12, 8]], np.int32)
        return x*y
    print(numpyArray())
    ```
    - The y variable is not calling the numpy module properly.
    - numpy is not imported correctly because as is used.
    - The function is not indented properly.
    - The shebang line is not necessary.
    ```
    Answer: The y variable is not calling the numpy module properly.
    Explanation: While the x variable is calling numpy using its declared local name, y is not using the local name. This will result in an error.
    ```
    
3. Which type of programming language is read and converted to machine code before runtime, allowing for more efficient code?
    - Object-oriented language
    - Compiled language
    - Interpreted language
    - Intermediate code
    ```
    Answer: Compiled language
    Explanation: A compiled language is translated into code readable by the target machine during development using a compiler.
    ```
    
4. Which of the following is not an IDE or code editor?
    - Eclipse
    - pip
    - Atom
    - PyCharm
    ```
    Answer: pip
    Explanation: The package manager pip is used in Python to install packages from repositories such as PyPI.
    ```
    
5. What does the PATH variable do?
    - Tells the operating system where to find executables
    - Returns the current working directory
    - Holds the command line arguments of your Python program in a list
    - Tells the operating system where to cache frequently used files
    ```
    Answer: Tells the operating system where to find executables
    Explanation: The PATH variable tells the operating system where to find executables.
